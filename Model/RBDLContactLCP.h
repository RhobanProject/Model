 * Solve the Linear Complimentary 
 * Problem used to compute which contact
 * constraints have to be activated or is going
 * to release.
 * Use Moby-Drake LCP solver.
 * RBDL model, position, velocity and applied
 * torque are given in addition to the constraint
 * set for only considered contact.
 * Inertia offsets (H matrix diagonal) is
 * also given (for joint internal inertia).
 *
 * The constraint set hold unilateral (inequality)
 * for non penetration and bilateral (equality) 
 * constraints representing no-slip infinite friction.
 * All bilateral constraints must have non zero value
 * in associated vector isBilateralConstraint.
 * (Associated force lambda will not be constraint by
 * complimentary. Always non zero).
 *
 * See Featherstone's book Chapter 11.3, for
 * details and notations.
 *
 * The computed contact force lambda (with zero
 * and non zero elements) is assigned in force
 * field of constraint set.
